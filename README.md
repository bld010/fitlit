# Fitlit
### Djavan Munroe & Brianna DelValle
This is the paired project from Module 2 of the Front End program at Turing School of Software & Design. 

In this project, we were given data from an activity tracker over many days. We needed to present a dashboard for a user to see their latest activity data, goals, and milestones. 

Fit Lit was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We leveraged classes and OOP paradigms to access and manipulate our data. Our class functionality was tested in Mocha and Chai. We also utilized jQuery, Packery, Draggabilly, and Chart.js to display our data on the DOM. 


The main objectives of this project include: 
* Implement ES6 classes
* Write dry, modular code that follows SRP
* Write and implement a robust testing suite using TDD
* Manipulate data using object and array prototype methods.
