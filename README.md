### Djavan Munroe & Brianna DelValle
This is the paired project from Module 2 of the Front End program at Turing School of Software & Design. 

In this project, we were given data from an activity tracker over many days. We needed to present a dashboard for a user to see their latest activity data, goals, and milestones. 

The main objectives of this project include: 
* Implement ES6 classes
* Write dry, modular code that follows SRP
* Write and implement a robust testing suite using TDD
* Manipulate data using object and array prototype methods.
